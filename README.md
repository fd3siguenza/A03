# Welcome To GITHUB

1.You signed up for GitHub now what else?

    - First lets famliarize ourselves with some terminology first
    - GIT=(open source program for tracking changes in files, it is the core technology of github. Social and User interface is built on top)
    - GITHUB=(GitHub is a web-based hosting service for software development projects that use the Git revision control system)
    - Repository=(A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.)
    - Clone(A clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. )
    - Commit(A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work)
    - Push(To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com)
    - Pull(Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them.)
    - Branch(A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch)
    - Merge(Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another)
    - Merge Conflict(A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file)
    - Fetch(When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Unlike git pull)
    - Remote(This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.)
